### Description
> *Haircountablitity* is a MVC application that uses a one to many relational database to assign clients to stylists at a hair salon.

### Installation

### Running the tests
#### Client Testing  
1. The client is the child object in this application, thus it will be tested first.
###### Test to see if the constructor creates an appropriate instance of the Client type.
>We will not be able to fail this test without a compile error, thus the only test we need is a passing test. A passing test means that .NET is working correctly.
